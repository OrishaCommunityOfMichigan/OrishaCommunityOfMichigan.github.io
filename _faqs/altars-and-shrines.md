Now let me just say that occasionally religious divination will send you to make a space for a specific Orisha, that is a completely different scenario than what we are discussing here. Here, we are talking about setting up an altar, shrine or what have you because you want to/feel drawn to/had a dream/think “insert Orisha here” is amazing/etc and you go about it the same way you would any other deity you felt drawn to. STOP!

Here is a podcast from [Omileti Olubunmi](https://orishawisdom.podbean.com/e/session-4-orisha-shrines-oh-my/) about the subject. She makes excellent points about what can go wrong when you set up a space to worship/pray/give offerings to an Orisha that didn’t ask for that space. How do you know what is actually there. Is it Yemoja? Maybe… but it is WAY more likely some random spirit attracted to the attention. And if you think it won’t happen to you, think again. We see this time and time again. My friend David Sosa with Ty Shaw did a facebook live that covers the subject, you can watch that [here](https://www.facebook.com/david.sosa.1217/videos/10156133964036204/). I include these references from other iles and traditions to give perspective – it’s not just me who has an issue with this folks.
