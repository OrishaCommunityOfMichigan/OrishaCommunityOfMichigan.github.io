Yemoja is the owner of every drop of water but you will typically see her associated with large bodies of water  like oceans and lakes.  Although she’s maternal and nurturing, she’s also fierce. Her punishments can be terrible when she’s outraged, but she’s fair minded and forgiving when proper remorse is shown. Contrary to popular belief she is not just a loving mother. Some of Yemoja’s roads are fierce warriors who fight with sabers or machetes and bathe in the blood of fallen enemies.

Yemoja is often depicted as a mermaid, and is associated with the moon, water, and feminine mysteries. She is the protector of women. She governs everything pertaining to women; childbirth, conception, parenting, child safety, love, and healing. She oversees deep secrets, ancient wisdom, the moon, sea shells, and the collective unconscious. According to myth, when her waters broke, it caused a great flood creating rivers and streams and the first mortal humans were created from her womb.

There are many roads of Yemoja: Okute, Asesú, Achabá and Mayelewo are some of them, and each one has a color combination all having shades of blue as a common denominator.
