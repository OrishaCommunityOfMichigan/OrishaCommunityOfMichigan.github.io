Oshún rules over the sweet waters of the world, the brooks, streams and rivers, embodying love, fertility. She is the youngest of the female orishas but retains the title of Iyalode or great queen. She heals with her sweet waters and with honey which she also owns.

She is the femme fatale of the orishas and once saved the world by luring Ogún out of the forests using her feminine wiles. And,in her path of Ibú Ikolé she saved the world from draught by flying up to heaven (turning into a vulture in the process).  Peacocks and vultures are hers and we use them often to represent her. She loves silks, perfumes, fans and mirrors, all kinds of jewelry, (especially coral and amber, gold and brass).
