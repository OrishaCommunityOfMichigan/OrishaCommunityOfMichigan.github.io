## How to add a page
- Adding a page should be done within the appropriate folder.
  - `_faqs`
  - `_orishas`
  - `_pages`
- See the `.md` files currently within these locations to get understanding on file naming conventions, headers and basic markdown.
- You can use a program like [Typora
](http://typora.io/) as a WYSIWYG editor for markdown.

## Adjusting the Navigation top/sidebar
- Simply make changes to the yml file: `_data/navigation.yml`

## Last bits of changes, if necessary
- Adjust the `_config.yml`, if you need to add in new `collections` or folders to `include`.

## How to add a post
- This site does not have any posts at this time. It is currently functioning with the FAQs page as the location for important information.
- If this changes:
  - add a page under the `_posts` folder, located under root.
  - file name should be formatted as such `2018-07-01-welcome.md`
  - [check out samples here for how to format the header](https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme/tree/master/docs/_posts)

## How to add an image
- Images can be added to a variety of locations.
    - If you intend on using it in multiple locations:
      - `assets/image.png`
    - If you intend on using it in one location, you may add it to the appropriate folder:
      - `_orishas/image.png`
      - `_posts/image.png`
